# COSMIIC-HIVE
Open-source high channel count impantable devices

## HIVE BACKGROUND
HIVE or "High density Interconnect with Variable Electronics" is a sub-project of the Cleveland Open Source Modular Implant Innovators Community (COSMIIC). The project goal is to design high channel count implantable medical devices for neural recording and modulation that can be added as modules to the COSMIIC system. Within each device folder, you will find sub-folders that contain documentation of the enclosure and electronics design, testing, and regulatory communications. More information on the COSMIIC system can be found [here](https://cosmiic.org/).

## HIVE TEAM
Electronics design: Cynthia Chestek, Alex Vaskov, Dylan Wallace, Olivia Lee  
Mechanical design: Doug Shire, Janet Gbur, Sonny Behan  
Regulatory Sponsorship: Paul Cederna  
COSMIIC Integration: Kevin Kilgore, Brian Smith, Joris Lambrecht
